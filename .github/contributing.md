# Contributing to Catroweb
:tada: Firstly, thank you for contributing to Catroweb! You are one of the pandas now! :tada:

## Styleguides
There is a comprehensive [styleguide](https://github.com/Catrobat/Catroweb-Symfony/wiki/Coding-Standard) available in our [wiki](https://github.com/Catrobat/Catroweb-Symfony/wiki/), aswell as a PHPStorm config file so you do not have to do a thing, just hitting `Refactor Code` and you are good to go! In the future there will be an automated report via Github Actions or our friendly Jenkins server, but this will take time.

## Pull requests
PR's are always appreciated! Please be sure to fill out the [PR Template](https://github.com/Catrobat/Catroweb-Symfony/blob/develop/.github/pull_request_template.md) as detailed as possible, you will be the hero of everyone who does code reviews
