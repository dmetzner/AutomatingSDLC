  Scenario: There should be more programs from the program owner be recommended
    When I go to "/app/project/1"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then I should see "More from Catrobat"
    And I should see "user1_p1"
    And I should see "user1_p2"
    And I should see "user1_p3"
    But I should not see "user2_p1"
    And I should not see "user2_p2"
    And I should not see "user3_p1"
    Then I should see 2 "#more-from-this-user-recommendations .program"

  Scenario: When the program owner only has one program don't show the "more-from" category
    When I go to "/app/project/6"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then I should not see "More from"
    But I should see 0 "#more-from-this-user-recommendations .program"

  Scenario: Not showing more programs when it's your own program
    Given I am on "app/login"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    When I fill in "username" with "Catrobat"
    And I fill in "password" with "123456"
    And I press "Login"
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    When I go to "/app/project/1"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then I should not see "More from"
    But I should see 0 "#more-from-this-user-recommendations .program"

  Scenario: When the user is on a program page the program should not also be recommended in the show more category
    When I go to "/app/project/4"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then I should see "More from user2"
    And I should see "user2_p2"
    And I should see 1 "#more-from-this-user-recommendations .program"
