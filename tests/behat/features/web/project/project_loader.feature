  Scenario Outline: Should see all buttons at homepage
    Given I am on <page>
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then the element <button> should be visible
    But the element <button2> should not be visible

    Examples:
      | button                              | button2                             | page            |

      | "#search-results .button-show-more" | "#search-results .button-show-less" | "/app/search/p" |

  Scenario Outline: The show more Button should disappear when all project are loaded
    Given I am on <page>
    And I wait for the page to be loaded

  Scenario Outline: When a user has loaded more projects and goes back and forward the number of loaded projects should
  be the same when a user returns to the page.
    Given I am on <page>
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then I should see 6 <projects>
    When I click <button>
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    Then I should see 12 <projects>
    When I move backward one page
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    And I move forward one page
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then I should see 12 <projects>
    When I click <button>
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    Then I should see 18 <projects>
    When I click <button>
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    Then I should see 23 <projects>
    When I move backward one page
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    And I move forward one page
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then I should see 23 <projects>
    When I click <button2>
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    Then I should see 18 <projects>
    When I click <button2>
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    Then I should see 12 <projects>
    When I move backward one page
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    And I move forward one page
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then I should see 12 <projects>
    When I click <button2>
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    Then I should see 6 <projects>
